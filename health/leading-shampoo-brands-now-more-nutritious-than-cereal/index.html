  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>News has emerged this morning that the nutritional content of shampoo is often higher than that of breakfast&nbsp;cereals.</p>

<!--BREAK-->

<p>
Rising uses of vitamin-rich ingredients such as aubergine in hair cleaning products means taking a shower can now count as one of your&nbsp;five-a-day</p>

<h3>Scurvy and&nbsp;Dandruff</h3>

<p>Captain Cook was reputed to have used Panone, an early forerunner of the vaunted Pantene 
range, to prevent his sailors catching scurvy and to keep their flowing locks shiny 
and free of split ends. His exact recipe is still unknown; however leading shampoo
chefs are confident they have, if not an exact replica, something of equivalent benefit
to both hair and&nbsp;digestion.</p>

<p>In 1821, George Stephenson, inventor of rockets, created similarly tasty head-soap. He
invented a method of growing straight cucumbers, and the experimentation leading up to
his eventual success left him with a veritable gourd plethora. He used this excess to
create the first anti-dandruff shampoo exclusively for&nbsp;babies.</p>

<h3>Shortage</h3>

<p>The Great Everything Shortage of the late 19th century led to a schism in the industry,&nbsp;however.</p>

<p>These days Pantene is very much &#8220;pro-vitamin&#8221;, in stark contrast to Kellog&#8217;s anti-thiamin stance.
With the increased use of other minerals such as iron and pyrite as shampoo ingredients 
Kellog&#8217;s are coming under increased pressure to reconsider their long disparaged&nbsp;position.</p>

<p>A spokesperson of the Flouride Advocacy Group was contacted for a statement,&nbsp;however</p>

<p>Kellog&#8217;s were unavailable for&nbsp;comment.</p>

<h3>Here&#8217;s The Nescience&nbsp;Bit</h3>

<p>Gerbins also warned people against interchanging the two products however.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t yet understand the long-term effects of cleaning your hair with
Crunchy Nut Cornflakes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so we strongly advise against&nbsp;trying&#8221;.</p>
