  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A member of the Nottingham Constabulary was today admitted to a local
psychiatric ward after a series of reports questioning his state of&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>It was revealed that Police Constable Frank Bang was confirmed by doctors to be
suffering from paranoia and delusional behaviour. Concerns were first raised by
senior officers as early as November last year when <span class="caps">PC</span> Bang was showing
&#8220;significant signs of paranoia&#8221; and &#8220;repeated delusions of&nbsp;conspiracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to colleagues, Frank increasingly seemed convinced of the existence of
a conspiracy to control his mind and his behaviour. &#8220;He kept telling us there as
some group of people out there intent on telling him what to say and think,&#8221;
said <span class="caps">WPC</span> Kelly Boson, a close colleague. &#8220;We would try and reason with him, but
nothing would convince him&nbsp;otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>The paranoia eventually extended to the public side of Frank&#8217;s work. &#8220;He came
into work one day in November this year claiming that there was some force
intent on stealing Christmas,&#8221; explained Sergeant Chris Cross in an official
press release. &#8220;He attempted to start a campaign to save it from being stolen
and he was unswayed in the belief that there was a brigade set out to stop him
doing&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>Calls for <span class="caps">PC</span> Bang to be sectioned finally came when his delusional actions
spread into writing letters fueled by his paranoia to the publications <em>The Sun</em>
and <em>The Daily Mail</em>. He tried to convince readers that &#8220;They&#8217;re trying to ban&nbsp;Christmas.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>This was the final straw,&#8221; said Sergeant Cross. &#8220;This was a clear case of a <span class="caps">PC</span>
gone mad. The decision was taken to limit the damage from Constable Bang&#8217;s
paranoia and see that he gets the help he&nbsp;needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is believed that <span class="caps">PC</span> Bang is to be held for thorough diagnosis and &#8220;whether he
is to be held for longer is unclear at this&nbsp;stage.&#8221;</p>
