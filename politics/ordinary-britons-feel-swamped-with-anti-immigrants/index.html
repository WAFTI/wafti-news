    <p>Large numbers of regular hard-working ordinary families complain that they feel
&#8220;swamped&#8221; and &#8220;overrun&#8221; with anti-immigration policy drives, a study by the
think-tank has&nbsp;shown.</p>
<p>The Policy and Legislation Examination Board (<span class="caps">PLEB</span>) has revealed in their
research that the majority of hard-working, ordinary, hard-working families feel
that the Britain’s cultural identity is being eroded by an increasing volume of
extreme-right anti-immigration&nbsp;views.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>It’s just getting completely out of hand,&#8221; said Tony Normal, a hard-working
worker from Workington. ‘You go into the town centre, go into Primark, and
everywhere you go there’s just anti-immigrant views. It makes me feel like a
stranger in my own&nbsp;country.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>My daughter was brought up here, she’s being trying to get a job for months but
there’s nothing left,&#8221; said Irene Bog-Standard, from Hull. &#8220;She just wants a
normal job in Conservative policy research like any other girl, but they’ve all
been taken by these anti-immigration types who’ve come in and pushed out the
local people. It’s like an open door, isn’t&nbsp;it?&#8221;</p>
<p>A similar picture is being seen in formerly chilled-out and bitchin’ places such
as Surrey in the south of England. &#8220;I used to able to just walk in here for a
marguerita on a Wednesday afternoon and have a good chat about the benefits of
multiculturalism or the best way to make Baba Ganoush&#8221;, says Bill Bowe, standing
outside the Woking Working Mens’ Club. &#8220;But now I can’t even get to the bar.
It’s just full of smelly honkys with pints in their hands banging on about
stockbroking and white power.&#8221; Asked what he thought was the cause of the change
in culture, he responds &#8220;Well, they’re after the benefits aren’t they? They come
here, don’t contribute anything, just spend their time playing golf and living
off the state. And the way they talk, you can’t even understand them can you? I
mean, what the hell is a tax&nbsp;haven?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Research undertaken by <span class="caps">PLEB</span> does seem to bear out these views. It has recorded a
sharp rise in anti-immigration across Europe, up 16 per cent on last year. The
underlying cause of the spike is unclear, but it is thought to be related to a
rise in grassroots activism in response to a knee-jerk irrational phobia of
brown&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>New activist platforms have sprung up in the last few months, such as the
extreme-right pressure group <span class="caps">NIMBYBBB</span>, Not In My Backyard You Black Bastards
(B), formed after Not In My Backyard You Black Bastards (A) was disbanded
following confusion. In Europe, the German organisation Pergoda has recently
seen a surge in support, although when contacted, did not know what its policies&nbsp;are.</p>
<p>Professor Dominic Senile, an expert in culture studies at a university, believes
that countering the problem requires long-term commitment to the issue. &#8220;Some
would say that the best solution would be the education of these Nazis and their
normalisation and integration into society. However, we have seen that other
countries have had success with aimless protest, lazy reactionism and complete
and utter ignorance. So before we think about killing, we should try&nbsp;that.&#8221;</p>
