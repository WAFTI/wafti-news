Shock and awe spread throughout the House of Commons yesterday as the Minister for Mammals, David Spert, was heard making derogatory remarks about a senior member of the Church of&nbsp;England.
</p>

<!--BREAK-->

<p>
The exact wording is yet to be confirmed by <span class="caps">HP</span>
sources, but the minister&#8217;s comments are claimed
to have been derisory towards the hat belonging
to Bishop John&nbsp;Thomas.
</p>

<p>
Anglican officials are said to be &#8220;deeply offended&#8221;
by the comments which they claim to have asserted
their hats to be &#8220;almost as silly&#8221; as their&nbsp;faith.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>We can all take a joke as much as the next religion,&#8221;
claims Gregory Peck, a church spokesman. &#8220;But, we draw
the line when the seriousness of our commitment
to dress sense is brought into&nbsp;question.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
Some have compared the incident to comments made last
year by the Home Secretary over ill-fitting 
Jewish footwear. A full
apology was immediately
demanded by the Jewish Council, which was
then only delivered sarcastically through a string&nbsp;telephone.
</p>

<p>
The Church of England is yet to make a formal request
for retribution, but preliminary reports suggest they
are likely to be&nbsp;ignored.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I won&#8217;t be able to keep a straight face if they
ask for an apology wearing those silly hats,&#8221; Mr.
Spert is alleged to have said yesterday evening
after half a bottle of&nbsp;Lambrini.
