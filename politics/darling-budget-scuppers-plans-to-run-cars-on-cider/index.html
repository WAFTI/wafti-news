The rising practice of circumventing <span class="caps">UK</span> fuel duty by
converting vehicles to run on cider has come under
attack from Chancellor Alistair Darling in his final
Budget before the&nbsp;election.
</p>

<!--BREAK-->

<p>
An increase of 10% above inflation has been announced
for the duty on ciders this&nbsp;year.
</p>

<p>
Over the last 12 months, several rural cider makers
have supplemented their incomes by selling off surplus
amounts of their stronger products as an alternative
to&nbsp;petrol.
</p>

<p>
The Discovery was first made by Matthew Bramley during
a Gala in his home town of Knobbed Russet, Sussex. He
was notably not fond of green apples, but found the Red Delicious,
so would make cider from them. On first tasting of a new
batch, his wife Katy remarked that it tasted like&nbsp;petrol.
</p>

<p>
The fruitful scheme requires some conversion work
to be carried out on the core of the car&#8217;s engine, but
a cider-powered family car saves its owner an
average of £20bn a year &#8212; up to 50% of the average
household&#8217;s total credit&nbsp;debt.
</p>

<p>
However, the latest measures laid out in the Darling
Budget seek to close what the Chancellor refers to
as a &#8220;loophole&#8221; to avoid the tax on&nbsp;petroleum.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>If we allow people to use alternative materials as
fuel, then we will lose millions to fuel duty not paid,&#8221;
<span class="caps">WAFTI</span> assumes he&nbsp;said.
</p>

<p>
Those most affected are companies based entirely on
cider-fueled transporation, such as Braeburn Buses
&#8212; a business based in Bedford, bringing biofuel benefits
to Bedfordshire-bound&nbsp;beings.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>It&#8217;s daylight roggery,&#8221; fumes Managing Director,
John Yak, using the letter &#8216;g&#8217; where he has run out of &#8216;b&#8217;s
due to using up all of his in the company slogan. &#8220;I can&#8217;t gelieve
those gastards are trying to gleed more money out of us like this.
I don&#8217;t like this one&nbsp;git.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
The public awaits a response from David Cameron on the
report, which many
experts are predicting to be&nbsp;&#8220;untelligible&#8221;.
