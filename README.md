WAFTI News
==========

This is the contributor repository for the
[Wafti News website](http://news.wafti.org.uk/).

Contributors
------------

To add a new article, create a branch, write it and raise a pull request for
someone else to review and merge.

To amend an article or edit the layout of the website itself, please also
create a branch and a pull request when it's ready.

Publishing
----------

Publishing happens by hand with the `makefile` right now, but eventually
more automated publishing will happen from the `master` branch. When this
happens, it will be even more important to contribute via branches and
pull requests.
