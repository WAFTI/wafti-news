    <p>Locals to the Cheshire town of Runcorn today received news of an accolade of a very high order as they were chosen as the namesake of a new character in the Pokemon video game series, produced by&nbsp;Nintendo.</p>
<p>Nintendo will be releasing <em>Pokemon: The Silver Jubilee Edition</em>
in Autumn this year which will be 26th in the
series of video games in which players battle with
small, fictional creatures called <em>Pokemon</em>,
which is short for &#8220;Pokey&nbsp;Monsters&#8221;.</p>
<p>It was said that the Japanese games giant had
shortlisted several <span class="caps">UK</span> settlements to be
the inspiration for the new character
introduced in the latest game in the&nbsp;franchise.</p>
<p>Amongst the towns that didn&#8217;t make the final
choice were Gateshead, Slough and Chipping Sodbury.
It is understood that the town of Skegness was
also approached, but declined to be shortlisted
on moral&nbsp;grounds.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Naturally, we&#8217;re delighted,&#8221; gleeful Runcorn
councillor Peter Chu tells <span class="caps">WAFTI</span> in his first
interview since parole. &#8220;This is going to be
a tremendous boon for all the people of&nbsp;Runcorn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Early estimates forecast an approximate
growth in tourism of 1.41% when the new
video game appears in the shops on 31st
October. Walking down the High Street,
it can be seen that local businesses are already
celebrating the&nbsp;honour.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>This is the best thing to happen to
the town since the building of the
Bridgewater canal,&#8221;
gushes Agnes Cream, a local travel agent
who is already negotiating discounted
B&amp;B rates in the area for any Japanese&nbsp;visitors.</p>
<p>A special parade will be held through the town
this Sunday, but those taking part are
struggling with the fact the nearest Pokemon
costume shop is in&nbsp;Manchester.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The parade will most definitely go ahead,&#8221;
confirms Gareth Silo, head of the town council,
adorning full Pikachu&nbsp;dress.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from Nintendo adds they
chose Runcorn after a painfully rigorous
decision process and they look forward
to having the town&#8217;s namesake spearhead
the latest game as its star&nbsp;character.</p>
<p>He tells us that &#8220;Runcorn is the perfect
pokey town for our&nbsp;pokemon.&#8221;</p>
