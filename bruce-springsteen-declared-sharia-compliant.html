    <p>caption &#8216;These are all mine,&#8217; says&nbsp;judge</p>
<p>In a major blow to shirt-wearing rifle patriots across the lower states, hero Bruce Springsteen was declared compatible with the teachings of the 
Koran by the <span class="caps">UK</span>&#8217;s foremost Sharia&nbsp;court.</p>

<!--BREAK-->

<p>The Boss was said to be &#8216;intrigued&#8217; by the fatwa, which will now permit the playing of one of his albums during Islamic bank holidays. His family 
are also said to be alive and well at time of going to &#8216;the Gutenberg&#8217;. &#8216;This is a great big boon to us all,&#8217; said Springsteen,&nbsp;megalomaniacally. 
</p>

<p>The decree was somewhat surprising, in the light of past animosity towards Him by every non-American. This includes Muslims and possibly some 
parakeets. Parakeets were not noted as fans of Himself prior to the 1970s, which was presumably when he released his first records. It is speculated 
that he has released several albums since. Astonishment was also expressed by some Springsteen analysts at the fact that the American midwest 
gave an excreted monkey-toss about what the <span class="caps">UK</span>&#8217;s opinion might be on something. No explanation has yet been offered by the spokesman for the&nbsp;midwest.</p>

<p>The director of the Muslim Religion of Dudley, Dr Wang Ping, confirmed &#8216;Something about this whole thing didn&#8217;t strike us as kosher, which was the 
final straw that clinched the albatross brain-fart.&#8217; He contradicted himself with an official press release via a Printmaster 3000, stating 
&#8216;Islamists will welcome this decision by the Sharia Court of Britain to recognise the wonder and beauty of His&nbsp;creations.&#8217;</p>

<p>Whilst the playing of His music will be permitted during public holidays, his fast songs must be confined to daylight hours. This is due to the 
fact that tempos above 130bpm (bodies per minaret) have been shown, via studies, to affect the geological structure of the bedrock in certain 
areas of the oil-rich states, something which America is keen to avoid. &#8216;It is paramount that the middle eastern area is kept as stable as 
possible, and we will do anything within our power to ensure this,&#8217; our American spokesman told&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>The news will be a blow to Yusuf Islam, who has actually been striving for this accolade for several years. Other artists known to have been 
shortlisted for potential Sharia compliance include Cliff Richard, the Israeli Breakfast Quartet and the <span class="caps">DJ</span> Vishnu&nbsp;Experience.</p>
