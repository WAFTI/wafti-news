    <p>Locals to the Cheshire town of Runcorn today received news of an accolade of a
very high order as they were chosen as the namesake of a new character in the
Pokemon video game series, produced by&nbsp;Nintendo.</p>
<p>Nintendo will be releasing <em>Pokemon: The Silver Jubilee Edition</em> in Autumn this
year which will be 26th in the series of video games in which players battle
with small, fictional creatures called <em>Pokemon</em>, which is short for &#8220;Pokey&nbsp;Monsters&#8221;.</p>
<p>It was said that the Japanese games giant had shortlisted several <span class="caps">UK</span> settlements
to be the inspiration for the new character introduced in the latest game in the&nbsp;franchise.</p>
<p>Amongst the towns that didn&#8217;t make the final choice were Gateshead, Slough and
Chipping Sodbury. It is understood that the town of Skegness was also
approached, but declined to be shortlisted on moral&nbsp;grounds.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Naturally, we&#8217;re delighted,&#8221; gleeful Runcorn councillor Peter Chu tells <span class="caps">WAFTI</span>
in his first interview since parole. &#8220;This is going to be a tremendous boon for
all the people of&nbsp;Runcorn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Early estimates forecast an approximate growth in tourism of 1.41% when the new
video game appears in the shops on 31st October. Walking down the High Street,
it can be seen that local businesses are already celebrating the&nbsp;honour.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>This is the best thing to happen to the town since the building of the
Bridgewater canal,&#8221; gushes Agnes Cream, a local travel agent who is already
negotiating discounted B&amp;B rates in the area for any Japanese&nbsp;visitors.</p>
<p>A special parade will be held through the town this Sunday, but those taking
part are struggling with the fact the nearest Pokemon costume shop is in&nbsp;Manchester.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The parade will most definitely go ahead,&#8221; confirms Gareth Silo, head of the
town council, adorning full Pikachu&nbsp;dress.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from Nintendo adds they chose Runcorn after a painfully rigorous
decision process and they look forward to having the town&#8217;s namesake spearhead
the latest game as its star&nbsp;character.</p>
<p>He tells us that &#8220;Runcorn is the perfect pokey town for our&nbsp;pokemon.&#8221;</p>
