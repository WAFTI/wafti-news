    <p>
A lacklustre archæological excavation conducted near the bantam town
of Ross-on-Wye, Hertfordshire, by local serfs has unearthed significant
evidence to dispute the long-held-until-today claim that Wales&nbsp;exists.
</p>

<p>
The discoveries include lost documents indicating a conspiracy orchestrated
by the Roman governor of Britain, Publius Ostorius Scapula, in which he
attempts to impress emperor Claudius by inventing military conquests. Historically,
historians have always attributed the first invasion of the area of Wales to Ostorius,
but it now appears his account was purely fabricated because he had run out of real
places to&nbsp;invade.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The whole basis of the history of Wales stemmed from the Romans first conquering the
area,&#8221; explains Brian Superior, a Welsh historian. &#8220;With the credibility of that
event blown out of the water, there&#8217;s little reason to accept Wales as having existed
at&nbsp;all.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
The startling revelations have stirred up controversy in Westminster with MPs
questioning the expense of devolution for a country that doesn&#8217;t exist. Calls have been
made by several backbenchers to cut back on Welsh MPs&#8217; expenses as well. Ieuan Wyn Jones,
the current leader of Plaid Cymru is expected to appear before an inquiry
to explain what the party has actually been doing for the last 44&nbsp;years.
</p>

<p>
Leeked papers from the Welsh Assembly show that up to 40% of its members may well
have been aware they were legislating for a nonexistent country and were
fully aware it was little more than a Roman clerical&nbsp;error.
</p>

<p>
News of the controversy has caused much unrest amongst Welsh citizens, with
public demonstrations being held in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport. Mass walk-outs
have been staged at the <span class="caps">DVLA</span> in protest at the possibility of removing powers
from the Welsh&nbsp;Assembly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>These allegations that we don&#8217;t exist are discriminatory and unfair,&#8221; reads the
largest sign we could read from our hotel room. Another placard read: &#8220;The
goverment should tread very&nbsp;Caerphilly.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
Virgin trains are &#8220;taking precautions&#8221; and have cancelled all services to Cardiff
for fear they may have been plunging them into the Irish Sea this whole time. Arriva
Trains Wales however insists it is maintaining &#8220;business as usual&#8221; and is also not
running any&nbsp;trains.
</p>

<p>
The results of the inquiry are expected to be broadcast by the end of the week.
Television bosses are yet to confirm whether they will bother showing it on <span class="caps">S4C</span>.
