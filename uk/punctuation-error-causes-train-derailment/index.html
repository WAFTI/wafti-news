  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>17 people were injured, some lightly, when a commuter train derailed at Tring this morning, causing widespread delays across the entire rail 
network and to some shipping&nbsp;lanes.</p>

<p>London Midland train company couldn&#8217;t believe it today when the 06.48 service from Northampton left the rails just north of Tring station with 948 
people compressed on board. The cause of the accident is speculated to have been a punctuation error in the recent London Midlands timetable. Arnie, 
of London Midland, said &#8216;The train was approaching Tring station when it left the track at approximately 08.23. We immediately shut down the 
surrounding area and summoned emergency personnel to the site to coordinate a press release. We are unable to comment further at this&nbsp;time.&#8217;</p>

<p>Whilst the damage to infrastructure was significant, injuries seemed to be slight. A passing hospital reported a small number of walking 
wounded attending A&E, with afflictions ranging from damaged wallets to an amalgamated orgasm. One passenger was admitted with advanced head cancer, 
although this is thought to be unrelated to the accident. No-one is believed to have been killed in the crash, but a number of people were seen 
wandering the track, confused and dazed and unsure what to do. Network Rail denied reports that engineers were at work on the line that&nbsp;morning.</p>

<p>London Midland have, apparently, begun an inquiry into the incident. Alexander Domestic-Appliances, editor of the suspected timetable, told <span class="caps">WAFTI</span>, 
&#8216;It appears that a full stop was accidentally inserted into the Northampton to Euston section of the timetable, immediately after the word &#8216;Tring&#8217;. 
This ad hoc punctuation was detected by our train&#8217;s Automatic Semantics System, <span class="caps">ASS</span>, and caused the train to bounce off of the rails at this point. 
Whilst we regret the loss of dignity suffered by our passengers, this does show that the system is operating as designed.&#8217; Asked whether the 
offending timetables will be withdrawn and corrected, Mr Domestic-Appliances lit a cigarette and leaned against a nearby fridge&nbsp;casually.</p>

<p>The incident has raised concerns over London Midland trains&#8217; <span class="caps">ASS</span>. The crash recalls an incident on a British Rail train in 1985, which collided 
with an emu near Chipping Sodbury after a performance of &#8216;Die Fledermaus&#8217; at a local theatre interfered with the trackwork. In both of these cases, 
the train&#8217;s technology responded to something stupidly unlikely to affect passenger safety. As a result, a recent resurgence in the popularity of light 
opera and grammar in the Home Counties has caused lesser publications to speculate on the likelihood of a much more serious accident in the near 
future. Network Rail has been unable to comment until it has completed its internal investigation of the tracks and signalling in the area, and has 
initiated engineering work to ensure that the Straussian conductivity of the rails is within the limits specified by some government&nbsp;guy.</p>
