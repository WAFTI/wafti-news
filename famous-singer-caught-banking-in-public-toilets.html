The entertainment industry shat itself this morning when reports leaked out that a famous singer had been arrested last night for financial&nbsp;indecency.
</p>

<!--BREAK-->

<p>
The singer could not be named for aural reasons,
but details of the case so far indicate that
the celebrity was found by authorities
banking in the cubicle of recently constructed public amenities
near York&nbsp;Minster.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The new York public toilet facilities were
certainly not intended for such use,&#8221; rants
Martin McBee, Head of the Flushable Facilities
department of York council, speaking through an&nbsp;interpreter. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Wee intend to flush out all of these types
from our cistern. We will not duck away from this
toilet issue. This man may be a celebrity, but
he made a fecal mistake thinking we would
not prosecute such behaviour.&nbsp;Bogbrush.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
Police sources have confirmed the man was found
committing indecent financial acts at approximately
23:02 last&nbsp;night.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>There were reports that people patronising
the urinals could hear the distinct sound
of hard selling,&#8221; confirms the first man we
found wearing a policeman&#8217;s&nbsp;helmet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>A call was logged with the local constabulary
and upon arrival, we apprehended the man
before his third return on&nbsp;investment.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
A offical police statement released today
reminds people that those wishing to bank
would be best advised to do it at&nbsp;home.
