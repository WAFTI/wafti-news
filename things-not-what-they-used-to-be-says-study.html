A study recently commissioned by the British Legion has confirmed that several aspects of modern culture such as fashion, values and mainstream music have changed over the last six&nbsp;decades.
</p>

<!--BREAK-->

<p>
Several claims have been made by aged pressure
groups for a number of years, but this is the
first time a comprehensive paper has been written
up with a notable amount of&nbsp;rigour.
</p>

<p>
Conclusions drawn by the report include
indications that young
girls wear notably less clothing in public
situations as they did pre-1960 &#8212; an act frequently deemed
unacceptably deplorable by elderly interest&nbsp;organisations.
</p>

<p>
Other findings included a detailed confirmation that
music isn&#8217;t the same as that being performed
between 1950 and&nbsp;1959.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>They really knew how to sing a proper song back then;
music today is just too loud,&#8221; concludes the first
chapter of the two chapter dossier, which sampled
2,500 music recordings from the last sixty years for
a thorough aural&nbsp;examination.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The youth of today don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re born,&#8221; opens
the second and final chapter. Later, it reveals,
&#8220;many years ago, one would be able to acquire
goods and services at lower&nbsp;prices.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most surprising revelation to some
was the uncovering of how poor current
television programming is compared to how it has
been in that&nbsp;past.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Everything these days is all noise, sex and violence,&#8221;
a concerned Patrice Loganberry, 68, tells <span class="caps">WAFTI</span> over
tea and biscuits. &#8220;I spend 8 hours of each day watching
the telly and none of it is worth watching. Except
that Bruce Forsyth; he&#8217;s&nbsp;lovely.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
A parliamenary response to the report is still pending.
James Mandelbrot, the cabinet minister for nostalgia,
was no longer available to comment like he used&nbsp;to.
