<p>
A member of the Nottingham Constabulary was today admitted to a local psychiatric ward after a series of reports questioning his state of mind.

It was revealed that Police Constable Frank Bang was confirmed by doctors
to be suffering from paranoia and delusional behaviour. Concerns were
first raised by senior officers as early as November last year when PC Bang
was showing "significant signs of paranoia" and "repeated delusions of
conspiracy."
</p>
<p>
According to colleagues, Frank increasingly seemed convinced of the
existence of a conspiracy to control his mind and his behaviour. "He
kept telling us there as some group of people out there intent on
telling him what to say and think," said WPC Kelly Boson, a close colleague.
"We would try and reason with him, but nothing would convince him
otherwise."
</p>
<p>
The paranoia eventually extended to the public side of Frank's work.
"He came into work one day in November this year claiming that there
was some force intent on stealing Christmas," explained Sergeant Chris
Cross in an official press release. "He attempted to start a campaign
to save it from being stolen and he was unswayed in the belief that
there was a brigade set out to stop him doing so.
</p>
<p>
Calls for PC Bang to be sectioned finally came when his delusional
actions spread into writing letters fueled by his paranoia to the
publications <em>The Sun</em> and <em>The Daily Mail</em>. He tried
to convince readers that "They're trying to ban Christmas."
</p>
<p>
"This was the final straw," said Sergeant Cross. "This was a clear case
of a PC gone mad. The decision was taken to limit the damage from
Constable Bang's paranoia and see that he gets the help he needs."
</p>
<p>
It is believed that PC Bang is to be held for thorough diagnosis and
"whether he is to be held for longer is unclear at this stage."
