Locals to the Cheshire town of Runcorn today received news of an accolade of a very high order as they were chosen as the namesake of a new character in the Pokemon video game series, produced by Nintendo.

Nintendo will be releasing _Pokemon: The Silver Jubilee Edition_
in Autumn this year which will be 26th in the
series of video games in which players battle with
small, fictional creatures called _Pokemon_,
which is short for "Pokey Monsters".

It was said that the Japanese games giant had
shortlisted several UK settlements to be
the inspiration for the new character
introduced in the latest game in the franchise.

Amongst the towns that didn't make the final
choice were Gateshead, Slough and Chipping Sodbury.
It is understood that the town of Skegness was
also approached, but declined to be shortlisted
on moral grounds.

"Naturally, we're delighted," gleeful Runcorn
councillor Peter Chu tells WAFTI in his first
interview since parole. "This is going to be
a tremendous boon for all the people of
Runcorn."

Early estimates forecast an approximate
growth in tourism of 1.41% when the new
video game appears in the shops on 31st
October. Walking down the High Street,
it can be seen that local businesses are already
celebrating the honour.

"This is the best thing to happen to
the town since the building of the
Bridgewater canal,"
gushes Agnes Cream, a local travel agent
who is already negotiating discounted
B&B rates in the area for any Japanese visitors.

A special parade will be held through the town
this Sunday, but those taking part are
struggling with the fact the nearest Pokemon
costume shop is in Manchester.

"The parade will most definitely go ahead,"
confirms Gareth Silo, head of the town council,
adorning full Pikachu dress.

A spokesperson from Nintendo adds they
chose Runcorn after a painfully rigorous
decision process and they look forward
to having the town's namesake spearhead
the latest game as its star character.

He tells us that "Runcorn is the perfect
pokey town for our pokemon."
