An unbalanced man from the village of Tilty, Essex wanted for murdering his own
mother in the county last week was picked up by Northumberland authorities today
as he was attempting to flee to France.

Mr. Alan Tiledamage -- a Geography teacher at Braintree Upper School -- was a
primary suspect after his mother, Sharon Tiledamage, was found dead in her home
in Great Dunmow on Friday. He is currently being questioned by the Morpeth
constabulary. 

Mrs. Sharon Tiledamage was found beaten to death by her own loofah in the pagoda
in her back garden, just next to the prize-winning gardenias. The gardineas are
to have statements taken by officers from Braintree in the next few days.

## Where did it all go wrong?
  <ul>
    <li>
      The name "Essex" derives from the Old English "Ä’ast Seaxna" which translates to "Easy Sex" and stems from the loose nature of the Saxon women who settled there so they could be close to London for the shops.
    </li>
    <li>
    This reputation caused an influx of questionable characters from both the Saxons and the Angles nearby.
    </li>
    <li>
      Due to lack of the numeracy required to read train timetables, few families have moved from the area leading to a small gene pool based on these medieval troublemakers and slags.
    </li>
    <li>
    Essex County Council was formed in 1889, but by then it was too late and all hope was lost.
    </li>
    <li>
    The boundary with Greater London was established in 1965 so that Londoners could disassociate themselves with their Essex neighbours.
    </li>

Morpeth police are yet to release a statement, except this one:

"We can confirm that Mr. Tiledamage is being held in custody over the death of
his mother in Essex. We are taking this matter very seriously as it's a dying
shame for anyone to spend their final days in Essex," Sergeant Pepper reads from
an edible press release at a press conference held during breaks in the US Open.

Harsher penalties were brought in for murder in the county back in November 2008
after the EU Court of Human Rights declared it an "affront to human dignity for
anyone's last memories of life on Earth to be of Essex." Several petitions were
circulated in Chelmsford to fight the legistlation, but few could write their
own name on the sheet.

"It's well crap," Councillor Jodie Marsh, Conservative chair of the Essex
Country Council, tells WAFTI during a glamour photoshoot. Defiant over the EU
ruling, she adds, "I never fort[sic] someone would kill their mum, but Essex is
well nice and definitely the best place to do it."

WAFTI sent several correspondents to Essex to get reactions from family and
friends, but only one returned alive. We all wish him a speedy recovery from his
injuries to report his findings in due course.
