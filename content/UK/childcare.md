title: Britain's worst criminal brought to justice

Thames Valley Police put yet another feather in its cap after arresting a woman
accused of 50 separate crimes shortly after brunch this morning.

Anne Sheep, from Milton Keynes, was first reported to have been in charge of
caring for her child without the appropriate Childcare Licence. Ofsted says
looking after children this way without being registered and licenced
contravenes the Nanny Act as the care lasted for longer than two hours and
constituted receiving "a reward".

"A neighbour reported Ms. Sheep saying she found raising her son 'very
rewarding' so this is in clear violation of the measures we put in place to
protect children from their mothers," an Ofsted inspector wrote on his Myspace
blog.

Civil Liberties campaigners and other whingers were said to be outraged at the
incident and have responded in full force by drawing Hitler moustaches on
photographs of the Minister for Children, Roger Duck.

In an interview over Facebook chat, Ms. Sheep told WAFTI: "When the inspector
called, the first thing she did was wipe her feet. Then she distracted me with a
card trick while another officer handcuffed me."

She was then taken to the police station and only allowed one phone call and to
be able to check Facebook for 10 minutes, whilst her child was taken into
protection.
