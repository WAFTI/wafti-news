A study recently commissioned by the British Legion has confirmed that several aspects of modern culture such as fashion, values and mainstream music have changed over the last six decades.

Several claims have been made by aged pressure
groups for a number of years, but this is the
first time a comprehensive paper has been written

Conclusions drawn by the report include
indications that young
girls wear notably less clothing in public
situations as they did pre-1960 -- an act frequently deemed

"They really knew how to sing a proper song back then;
music today is just too loud," concludes the first
chapter of the two chapter dossier, which sampled
2,500 music recordings from the last sixty years for
a thorough aural examination.

"The youth of today don't know they're born," opens
the second and final chapter. Later, it reveals,

"Everything these days is all noise, sex and violence,"
a concerned Patrice Loganberry, 68, tells WAFTI over
tea and biscuits. "I spend 8 hours of each day watching

A parliamenary response to the report is still pending.
James Mandelbrot, the cabinet minister for nostalgia,
was no longer available to comment like he used to.
