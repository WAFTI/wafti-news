title: "Iced Rain" Baffles Scientists

Scientists in the UK are still unable to explain the unusual shift in weather experienced throughout much of the country over the last week.

The British Isles has always been home to much
wetness, but its residents were faced over the last seven days
with a rather
unusual difference. Since Monday last week, there
were several reports of a phenomon of white, icy
particles falling from the sky.
</p>
<p>
"It's almost as if the rain froze before falling
to Earth," suggests Patrick Thistle, head of Water
Sciences at Nottingham Trent University.
</p>
<p>
"There's no good explanation at this early stage,
but we've been able to collect samples and are
running several tests. We hope to be able to
describe the origin of this phenonenom soon."
</p>
<p>
Many of the country's roads and train lines have
been closed off as Gordon Brown declared a state
of emergency on Thursday. Many commuters complained
of unusual behaviour from their cars.
</p>
<p>
"This stuff is really bizarre," reports Sid Cup from
Letchworth. "I was doing my usual commute to London
and my car was sliding all over the road. My wife
tried to blame it on the white russians I had with
my cereal, but I know this stuff was involved somehow."
</p>
<p>
Mary Snowflake, chairperson of the Milton Keynes council
informs she had to shut down the whole mass transit
system. "We started getting reports of some bizarre,
white substance falling from the sky that was affecting
local drivers' ability, so we decided to take no
risks. At a time where nobody should be out in their cars,
the most sensible thing to do is to shut down all buses."
</p>
<p>
"All that is known so far is the substance appears to be
similar to or composed of ice, perhaps alike the ice
content of a snowcone."
</p>
<p>
Many Milton Keynes residents have alikened the precipitate
to the ground covering inside the local indoor ski slope,
known as the "SNO!zone". However, management
denies any connection.
</p>
<p>
What is known is that such a phenomenon has never been observed
in the UK before. The Met Office has confirmed that its records
show much cold rain, but never anything comparable
to recent events.

The government has sent a fact-finding group abroad to the
Bahamas to hope to acquire some scientific findings from
our international partners.
