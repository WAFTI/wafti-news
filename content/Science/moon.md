title: Anniversary of Moon Landing Reignites Conspiracy Claims

Previously waning lunacy was in full view this month as the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission sparked up fresh controversy over whether or not the moon was faked.

On July 20th, 1969, the United States landed the first
white, male human beings on the surface of the Earth's
moon with an estimated 1 billion eyes witnessing the
historic moment. Despite these 500 million observers,
many conspiracy theorists maintain the accusation that
the entire moon is a hoax concocted by NASA, the US
Government and the TUC.
</p>
<p>
"There is absolutely no way for the moon to be possible,
let alone for a man to walk on it," scoffs Geoffrey Van Allen,
founder of Lunar Sceptics, a moon-denying interest group.
</p>
<p>
"We have analysed 1000s of photographs taken of the moon
and every single one shows signs of tampering. The famous
shot of Buzz Aldrin taken on its surface could easily
have been taken in any Asda car park and touched up in a
studio."
</p>
<p>
Critics of the hoax claims point to the continuing
visibility of our lunar compadre as seen through
several devices such as telescopes, binoculars or eyes.
</p>
<p>
"Look; it's right there," a scientist explains.
</p>
<p>
The "people" of the conspiracy theory publication,
"Moon? Yeah, right..." are still not convinced
by this salient evidence.
</p>
<p>
"We have testimonies from several Hollywood experts
that expose a secret project experimenting with sky
projection technology capable of maintaining something
such as a picture of a moon in our skies perpetually.
We have hard evidence this project dates back years
before the moon itself," explains Chief Editor
Roy O'Rovers in a drawn-out game of charades.
</p>
<p>
Other attempts to debunk the claims point to evidence
from tidal patterns across the globe -- now known
by most outside of the USA to be due to the
gravitational effect of the moon and not Poseidon.
</p>
<p>
"It's very clear that the wave machines used in
novelty swimming baths today were the side product
of the NASA tide project," continued Mr. O' Rovers
fervently. "We have detected the main points at
which NASA has stationed wave generators to force
a tidal effect -- all part of an elaborate scheme
to act as if there were a moon pulling on the seas."
</p>
<p>
Most astronomers were too busy with real work to
respond to these claims, but a group of GCSE
Science students were able to tell WAFTI they
consider moon hoax proponents to be "a bunch
of saddos[sic]." Their parents were unavailable to comment.
