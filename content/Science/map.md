title: Were Vikings the first on the moon?

The authenticity of 15th century Viking map clearly depicting the moon five centuries before Neil Armstrong's arrival has been confirmed by a great Dane.

The map has been terribly controversial since its discovery
in 1988, at which time it was dismissed as Roman Catholic
tomfoolery intended to discredit Christopher Columbus during
an intellectual property dispute. Lars Supper, grand
commissioner of the Danish Map School, claims that there
is no sign of forgery.

"We have run extensive tests between games of Cluedo
and not once have we seen evidence this was Catholic
monkeyshines," Prof. Supper tells WAFTI via SMS.

The map shows Europe, Greenland and a large, round
entity labelled "Møøn". The drawing is poor, but
historians are quick to remind that art teachers
were not invented until the Great Depression in the
1930s. Also, the distance between Greenland
and what we now know today as the Moon,
 is totally inaccurate compared to what we can
determine by modern GPS.

<p>
The settlement of the area has now been linked to the
Icelandic sagas of Norsemen under Leif "Sony" Eriksson
from around 1000 CE.

Despite these shortcomings, Prof. Supper maintains the map
is clear evidence the vikings were the first to send
a ship to the moon. However, many killjoy scientists
remain sceptics.

<p>
Opponents have alledged that the ink used on the map
contains a substance known as mayonase titanium bromide,
which today is only used in felt-tip pens -- something
not invented until the 16th century. This has now
been disproved in light of recent discoveries
showing that Michaelangelo had used felt tips
on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

"It's clearly silly; everybody knows Christopher Columbus
was the first to discover America," hints Ronald Watermelon,
leading historian and director of Columbus Tours. "Anything
to the contrary is just pissing in the wind."

A British archeologist first discovered the map hanging
from a telegraph pole in Basingstoke, Nottinghamshire in 1957.
It was then traded to the director of the British Museum
in 1965 for a David Beckham "shiny" during a lunch break.
</p>
<p>
There the map has remained until late 2008, when it was
released for study. Professor Lars Supper will present
his findings during the Coronation Street advert
break next week.
