title: Monkeys excel at grammar

<p>
Studies on monkeys have shown their grasp of grammar to outshine that of the average 14-16 year old.

<p>
The journal Monkey Tales has today published
research in which cotton-top tamarins were
able to spot incorrect syntax and word usage
far better than the average GCSE student.
</p>
<p>
They familiarised the monkeys with introductary
reading to the works of Roald Dahl, Charles Dickens
and Jeffrey Archer as well as conversational
classes, then recorded their reaction to
Internet forums, Facebook profiles and a sample
of several Twitter accounts.
</p>
<p>
In the experiment, they were shown so-called
"status updates" as well as comment posts across
several websites. The aim was to investigate
the ability to spot flagrant misuse of words
as well as incorrect spellings.
</p>
<p>
The monkeys were trained to indicate what
they deemed an abuse of the English language in mild
cases with a gesture of placing their palm over their
faces; larger mistakes were indicated with head-desk interaction.
</p>
<p>
The same experiment was repeated with a sample of
British GCSE students.
</p>
<p>
The results indicated that monkeys were 20% more
likely to recognise cases of "of" being misused
as a verb, 15% more likely to spot the incorrect
use of homophones such as "there" and "their" and
a staggering 89% more likely to know when
an apostrophe should and should not be used.
</p>
<p>
"Simple temporal ordering is shared with non-human animals,"
the lead researcher tells WAFTI News while drying his hair.
"This means we'd expect basic levels of language skill
to be achievable even to monkeys."
</p>
<p>
"However, it seems such simple aspects escape the
generation now entering the workplace. It's a prospect
that is certainly cause for concern. If their language
skills are in fact lower than those of other primates,
then we could see them losing out on jobs to them."
</p>
<p>
The government has yet to comment on pressure to
help protect British, human workers from losing
out to more competent immigrants from the same
biological order.
</p>
<p>
"We need the government to put a stop to these monkey's
coming into our country and taking our jobs just
because they are willing to work for peanut's," rants
a red-faced member of the British Numpty Party on
a group called "BRITTISH JOB'S NOW!!!" on social
networking site Facebook. "Saying
their more qualified or more smarter is just PC gone mad."
</p>
<p>
The European Union is assembling a panel to investigate
the research and its significance in light of recent
calls to expand the EU borders into the animal kingdom.
