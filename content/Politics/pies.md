title: Shadow Minister: Government has "eaten all the pies"

<p>
Parliament yesterday erupted into chaos after a member of the shadow cabinet accused the current Government of having eaten "all the pies".
</p>
<!--BREAK-->
<p>
Such claims came from the right
honourable David Mouse, MP for Taunton's
cider farms, in the light of recent
controversy over the number of pies MPs
have been eating.
</p>
<p>
Traditionally, every member of the house
would be entitled to a pie every lunch
from the Westminster canteen, but documents
leaked under the Freedom From Information Act
2004 have shown that most MPs are claiming
at least two pies.
</p>
<p>
"It makes a mockery of the whole system," claims
Martin Mocherie, founder of the "Fewer pies,
fewer lies" campaign, a frugality and honesty
advocacy group.
</p>
<p>
"At a time when pie stocks are at their lowest,
these politicians are claiming more pies than
they need."
</p>
<p>
The system was originally set up in 1968 when
the UK elected its first Houses of Parliament
representative from Melton Mowbray. It was voted
that members of parliament travelling to London
from regions where pie consumption was normally
higher could claim more than the one statutory pie
allowance, which benefitted those coming from the
far North and the West Country, as well as
the larger members from the Isle of Wight.
</p>
<p>
However, there have been many calls over the last two weeks
for the system to be reviewed due to many
members claiming a second pie they arguably
do not need.
</p>
<p>
Steven Kidney, MP for Crawley, defends MPs'
actions, stating that "many members travel
some considerable distance to reach
parliament and can be very hungry as a result."
</p>
<p>
"If our politicians are expected both to represent
their local constituency and attend parliament,
they need to be able to claim as many pies as
they need."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Mouse, who cannot be named in a normal
voice, accuses the current Government of
going "too far" and says Britain is in a
"real danger" of running out of pies "very soon".
</p>
<p>
"I fear the current Government is going to go
down in history as the one that ate all the pies,"
the minister tells WAFTI through a straw.
</p>
<p>
An official response is to be made by the Prime
Minister in the house tomorrow after all the mess
has been cleaned up.
