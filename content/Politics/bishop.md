<p>
Shock and awe spread throughout the House of Commons yesterday as the Minister for Mammals, David Spert, was heard making derogatory remarks about a senior member of the Church of England.
</p>

<p>
The exact wording is yet to be confirmed by HP
sources, but the minister's comments are claimed
to have been derisory towards the hat belonging
to Bishop John Thomas.
</p>
<p>
Anglican officials are said to be "deeply offended"
by the comments which they claim to have asserted
their hats to be "almost as silly" as their faith.
</p>
<p>
"We can all take a joke as much as the next religion,"
claims Gregory Peck, a church spokesman. "But, we draw
the line when the seriousness of our commitment
to dress sense is brought into question."
</p>
<p>
Some have compared the incident to comments made last
year by the Home Secretary over ill-fitting 
Jewish footwear. A full
apology was immediately
demanded by the Jewish Council, which was
then only delivered sarcastically through a string
telephone.
</p>
<p>
The Church of England is yet to make a formal request
for retribution, but preliminary reports suggest they
are likely to be ignored.
</p>
<p>
"I won't be able to keep a straight face if they
ask for an apology wearing those silly hats," Mr.
Spert is alleged to have said yesterday evening
after half a bottle of Lambrini.
