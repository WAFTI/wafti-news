After its worst financial year in over six months, Nottingham Trent could be a
target of a takeover bid by Virgin to rescue and rebrand the struggling
educational establishment.

Sir Richard Branson, the volant Chairman of the Virgin Group, says he has
"tremendous plans" for the instituion, but isn't giving too much away at this
stage.

"I'm sure we'll do something with it, " he forecasts.

Nottingham Trent will be the seventh didactic institution acquired by the
porgonophile and certainly the first worth mentioning. With this acquisition,
the Virgin Group will manage two universities, one grammar school, three
colleges and one art school under the Virgin Scholar brand.

## History of "Virgin Scholar"

* In 1996, Sir Richard Branson wins London Art College in a poker tournament. He leaves it largely unchanged, except all "still life" arrangements are switched from bowls of fruit to cans of Virgin Cola.
* Three years later, Virgin buys Anglia Polytechnic University (now Anglia Ruskin University) and founds the Virgin Scholar brand.
* By 2004, Virgin Scholar has expanded to include Boston Grammar School, Barking College, Plymouth College of Art and Design and Tresham Institute of Further and Higher Education.
* From 2005 onwards, all degrees, certificates and exam results included the Virgin logo and Â£10 free credit on Virgin Mobile.

## Company Perks

Benefits that are brought to a Virgin Scholar institution include discounted
rates on Virgin Holidays in the Summer, increased signal strength for Virgin
Mobile phones, free Virgin Cola between 2pm and 4pm weekdays, preferencial rates
on Virgin Books and free shuttle buses to Virgin Festivals. Any student radio is
assimilated into Virgin Radio, campus eating facilities are incorporated into
Virgin Catering and the top five students in any course are given free balloon
flights.

## Finance

However, a proposal to provide student loans to Virgin Scholar customers through
Virgin Money raised at least 7 eyebrows at the Student Loans Company Ltd., the
usual source of student funding since 1990.

"We're meant to be doing that," sighs long-time director David Firth with an air
of 1990 Post-Thatcher ennui.

New students, however, are warm to the idea of a loan company that will answer
the phone. "Virgin Mobile customers will be allowed straight through without
delay," promises an optimistic Branson.

## Epilogue

The takeover proposal is due to go before Nottingham Trent Chancellor Sir
Michael Parkinson first thing tomorrow morning, after he picks up his dry
cleaning.
