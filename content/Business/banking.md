The entertainment industry shat itself this morning when reports leaked out that
a famous singer had been arrested last night for financial indecency.

The singer could not be named for aural reasons, but details of the case so far
indicate that the celebrity was found by authorities banking in the cubicle of
recently constructed public amenities near York Minster.

"The new York public toilet facilities were certainly not intended for such
use," rants Martin McBee, Head of the Flushable Facilities Department of York
council, speaking through an interpreter.

"Wee intend to flush out all of these types from our cistern. We will not duck
away from this toilet issue. This man may be a celebrity, but he made a fecal
mistake thinking we would not prosecute such behaviour. Bogbrush."

Police sources have confirmed the man was found committing indecent financial
acts at approximately 23:02 last night.

"There were reports that people patronising the urinals could hear the distinct
sound of hard selling," confirms the first man we found wearing a policeman's
helmet.

"A call was logged with the local constabulary and upon arrival, we apprehended
the man before his third return on investment."

A official police statement released today reminds people that those wishing to
bank would be best advised to do it at home.
