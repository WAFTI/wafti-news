Police recordings released under the Freedom from Information Act 2010 have
revealed the surprising accounts of several convicted serial killers apologising
for their actions.

In what some are calling a bold and unexpected move, mass murderers such as
Harold Shipman and Peter Sutcliffe can be seen giving their heartfelt apologies
for the acts they committed and the lives they affected.

"I acted entirely out of my own selfish desires and for that I am deeply, very
sorry," an apologetic Harold Shipman is heard to say on video footage acquired
by WAFTI through entirely legitimate means.

A remorseful Peter Sutcliffe says, "I'm incredibly sorry for my actions and the
lives they affected."

Similar statements can be heard from Myra Hindley, Fred West and Trevor Hardy.

Whilst these statements have been a surprise to many, many people have been
calling it "too little, too late".

"I'm not having it," says Jane Button, a caretaker from Crewe. "An apology this
late is all well and good, but it's not going to get my husband's pension back
or pay our mortgage."

Will Fully-Ignorant, head of Lock Em Up -- a prison advocacy group -- says he
won't accept the apologies. "This is simply not good enough. It merely tells us
they knew full well what they were doing was wrong, but they only cared about
themselves. I'm not having it. Lock them up, that's what I say."

The government is yet to release a statement on the matter, but it believed that
they will be looking to divert even more tax money into bailing some of these
criminals out of prison.
