<p>
Police recordings released under the Freedom from Information Act 2010 have revealed the surprising accounts of several convicted serial killers apologising for their actions.
</p>
<!--BREAK-->
<p>
In what some are calling a bold and unexpected move,
mass murderers such as Harold Shipman and Peter
Sutcliffe can be seen giving their heartfelt
apologies for the acts they committed and the lives
they affected.
</p>
<p>
"I acted entirely out of my own selfish desires
and for that I am deeply, very sorry," an apologetic
Harold Shipman is heard to say on video footage
acquired by WAFTI through entirely legitimate means.
</p>
<p>
A remorseful Peter Sutcliffe says, "I'm incredibly
sorry for my actions and the lives they affected."
</p>
<p>
Similar statements can be heard from Myra Hindley,
Fred West and Trevor Hardy.
</p>
<p>
Whilst these statements have been a surprise to many,
many people have been calling it "too little, too late".
</p>
<p>
"I'm not having it," says Jane Button, a caretaker
from Crewe. "An apology this late is all well and good,
but it's not going to get my husband's pension
back or pay our mortgage."
</p>
<p>
Will Fully-Ignorant, head of Lock Em Up -- a prison
advocacy group -- says he won't accept the apologies.
"This is simply not good enough. It merely tells us
they knew full well what they were doing was wrong,
but they only cared about themselves. I'm not
having it. Lock them up, that's what I say."
</p>
<p>
The government is yet to release a statement on the
matter, but it believed that they will be looking
to divert even more tax money into bailing some of these
criminals out of prison.
