    <p>The authenticity of 15th century Viking map clearly depicting the moon five
centuries before Neil Armstrong&#8217;s arrival has been confirmed by a great&nbsp;Dane.</p>
<p>The map has been terribly controversial since its discovery in 1988, at which
time it was dismissed as Roman Catholic tomfoolery intended to discredit
Christopher Columbus during an intellectual property dispute. Lars Supper, grand
commissioner of the Danish Map School, claims that there is no sign of&nbsp;forgery.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>We have run extensive tests between games of Cluedo and not once have we seen
evidence this was Catholic monkeyshines,&#8221; Prof. Supper tells <span class="caps">WAFTI</span> via <span class="caps">SMS</span>.</p>
<p>The map shows Europe, Greenland and a large, round entity labelled &#8220;Møøn&#8221;. The
drawing is poor, but historians are quick to remind that art teachers were not
invented until the Great Depression in the 1930s. Also, the distance between
Greenland and what we now know today as the Moon, is totally inaccurate compared
to what we can determine by modern <span class="caps">GPS</span>.</p>
<p>The settlement of the area has now been linked to the Icelandic sagas of
Norsemen under Leif &#8220;Sony&#8221; Eriksson from around 1000 <span class="caps">CE</span>.</p>
<p>Despite these shortcomings, Prof. Supper maintains the map is clear evidence the
vikings were the first to send a ship to the moon. However, many killjoy
scientists remain&nbsp;sceptics.</p>
<p>Opponents have alledged that the ink used on the map contains a substance known
as mayonase titanium bromide, which today is only used in felt-tip pens &#8212;
something not invented until the 16th century. This has now been disproved in
light of recent discoveries showing that Michaelangelo had used felt tips on the
ceiling of the Sistine&nbsp;Chapel.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>It&#8217;s clearly silly; everybody knows Christopher Columbus was the first to
discover America,&#8221; hints Ronald Watermelon, leading historian and director of
Columbus Tours. &#8220;Anything to the contrary is just pissing in the&nbsp;wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>A British archeologist first discovered the map hanging from a telegraph pole in
Basingstoke, Nottinghamshire in 1957. It was then traded to the director of the
British Museum in 1965 for a David Beckham &#8220;shiny&#8221; during a lunch&nbsp;break.</p>
<p>There the map has remained until late 2008, when it was released for study.
Professor Lars Supper will present his findings during the Coronation Street
advert break next&nbsp;week.</p>
