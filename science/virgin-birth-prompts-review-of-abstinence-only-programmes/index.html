    <p>Judean officials have confirmed reports of a pregnant
teenager giving birth today despite new abstinence-only
programmes now entering their second year of&nbsp;running.</p>

<!--BREAK-->

<p>Sources close to King Herod informed <span class="caps">WAFTI</span> that they
received news this morning that a teenager named Mary has
in fact successfully given birth in the small town of
Bethlehem, Gloucestershire. This birth is controversial
as the Bethlehem district has, for over 18 months now, been
a forerunner in the campaign for teenage abstinence as
a form of birth&nbsp;control.</p>

<p>Judean governmental figures have long cited abstinence
as &#8220;the only form of birth control to be 100% effective&#8221;
and in August 2 B.C., the Herod administration brought in a
Judean-wide campaign to educate teenagers as to its&nbsp;benefits.</p>

<p>However, protest groups have been claiming since the
programme&#8217;s introduction that it is intrinsically flawed.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve said from the start: this programme is founded on
untruths,&#8221; claims Helen Trout, head of Leave Your Hat On, a
pro-condom pressure group, &#8220;The simple fact is that
if we are to promote real birth control, then we must
be educating our youngsters that they need to be safe whatever
decisions they choose to make. This incident is a kick in
the face to our government&#8217;s ill-advised&nbsp;schemes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>It&#8217;s a hard issue, certainly and, at a stretch, we could
see teenage sex figures going down, but when it comes down to it
our only shot at stopping this flow is to promote safe
usage of condoms. This incident has brought the issue to a head
and I hope now we see a push in the right&nbsp;direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>This morning&#8217;s birth has certainly stirred a lot of controversy
and it remains to be seen how the government will move in light
of these revelations. A source close to King Herod informs
<span class="caps">WAFTI</span>, &#8220;The King is deeply troubled by the birth of this child.
It is unacceptable that such an anomaly should be allowed to
ruin such a beneficial programme and King Herod has promised
to take whatever action is needed, however&nbsp;drastic.&#8221;</p>
