  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A study recently commissioned by the British Legion has confirmed that several
aspects of modern culture such as fashion, values and mainstream music have
changed over the last six&nbsp;decades.</p>
<p>Several claims have been made by aged pressure groups for a number of years, but
this is the first time a comprehensive paper has been written up with a notable
amount of&nbsp;rigour.</p>
<p>Conclusions drawn by the report include indications that young girls wear
notably less clothing in public situations as they did pre-1960 &#8212; an act
frequently deemed unacceptably deplorable by elderly interest&nbsp;organisations.</p>
<p>Other findings included a detailed confirmation that music isn&#8217;t the same as
that being performed between 1950 and&nbsp;1959.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>They really knew how to sing a proper song back then; music today is just too
loud,&#8221; concludes the first chapter of the two chapter dossier, which sampled
2,500 music recordings from the last sixty years for a thorough aural&nbsp;examination.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The youth of today don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re born,&#8221; opens the second and final
chapter. Later, it reveals, &#8220;many years ago, one would be able to acquire goods
and services at lower&nbsp;prices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising revelation to some was the uncovering of how poor
current television programming is compared to how it has been in that&nbsp;past.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Everything these days is all noise, sex and violence,&#8221; a concerned Patrice
Loganberry, 68, tells <span class="caps">WAFTI</span> over tea and biscuits. &#8220;I spend 8 hours of each day
watching the telly and none of it is worth watching. Except that Bruce Forsyth;
he&#8217;s&nbsp;lovely.&#8221;</p>
<p>A parliamenary response to the report is still pending. James Mandelbrot, the
cabinet minister for nostalgia, was no longer available to comment like he used&nbsp;to.</p>
