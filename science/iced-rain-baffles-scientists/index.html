    <p>Scientists in the <span class="caps">UK</span> are still unable to explain the unusual shift in weather
experienced throughout much of the country over the last&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>The British Isles has always been home to much wetness, but its residents were
faced over the last seven days with a rather unusual difference. Since Monday
last week, there were several reports of a phenomon of white, icy particles
falling from the&nbsp;sky.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>It&#8217;s almost as if the rain froze before falling to Earth,&#8221; suggests Patrick
Thistle, head of Water Sciences at Nottingham Trent&nbsp;University.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>There&#8217;s no good explanation at this early stage, but we&#8217;ve been able to collect
samples and are running several tests. We hope to be able to describe the origin
of this phenonenom&nbsp;soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the country&#8217;s roads and train lines have been closed off as Gordon Brown
declared a state of emergency on Thursday. Many commuters complained of unusual
behaviour from their&nbsp;cars.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>This stuff is really bizarre,&#8221; reports Sid Cup from Letchworth. &#8220;I was doing my
usual commute to London and my car was sliding all over the road. My wife tried
to blame it on the white russians I had with my cereal, but I know this stuff
was involved&nbsp;somehow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Snowflake, chairperson of the Milton Keynes council informs she had to shut
down the whole mass transit system. &#8220;We started getting reports of some bizarre,
white substance falling from the sky that was affecting local drivers&#8217; ability,
so we decided to take no risks. At a time where nobody should be out in their
cars, the most sensible thing to do is to shut down all&nbsp;buses.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>All that is known so far is the substance appears to be similar to or composed
of ice, perhaps alike the ice content of a&nbsp;snowcone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many Milton Keynes residents have alikened the precipitate to the ground
covering inside the local indoor ski slope, known as the &#8220;<span class="caps">SNO</span>!zone&#8221;. However,
management denies any&nbsp;connection.</p>
<p>What is known is that such a phenomenon has never been observed in the <span class="caps">UK</span>
before. The Met Office has confirmed that its records show much cold rain, but
never anything comparable to recent&nbsp;events.</p>
<p>The government has sent a fact-finding group abroad to the Bahamas to hope to
acquire some scientific findings from our international&nbsp;partners.</p>
