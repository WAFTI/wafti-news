Experienced geologist Dr Petro Logical, 46, revealed yesterday to his field colleagues that he was thinking about putting down his hammer and having 
some&amp;nbsp;lunch. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--BREAK--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Dr Logical, based in Wapping, was in Canada at the time of the incident, investigating speciments of Nectocaris in part of the Burgess Shale 
Formation in British Columbia. At approximately 12.30pm, whilst he was separated from the rest of his party and just concluding a detailed study of a 
particularly well-preserved fossil of Nectocaris which he had been working on for several days, he shocked colleagues and co-workers by announcing 
that he was going to down tools and eat some&amp;nbsp;lunch.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The news sent longitudinal shock waves through the field party. &amp;#8216;In the 27 years that I have known Petro, he has never, to my knowledge, eaten food,&amp;#8217; 
said a colleague  working in the area, &amp;#8216;before 1pm.&amp;#8217; Others present were similarly amazed. &amp;#8216;I&amp;#8217;ve never heard of anything like this ever happening 
before,&amp;#8217; said another worker, understood to a be one of Dr Logical&amp;#8217;s research students. &amp;#8216;Some people are saying that he simply finished his morning&amp;#8217;s 
work earlier than usual, and decided to have an early lunch, but I just cannot accept&amp;nbsp;that&amp;#8217;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Breakfast at normal&amp;nbsp;time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is understood that, prior to yesterday&amp;#8217;s incident, Dr Logical was a man of regular habit, having got out of bed nearly every day in the last 40 
years. The religiousness of his daily life was corroborated by another of his colleagues, Prof Adolf Hitlerino. &amp;#8216;Right from when I first knew him, 
Petro was never a man,&amp;#8217; said Prof Hitlerino, &amp;#8216;to do things spontaneously. We once worked together in Pompeii in 1978, and I can clearly remember that 
he always ate breakfast just after he got up. He never ate dinner after he had gone to bed, and his showers were always taken before he got to the 
office. He was just that sort of&amp;nbsp;guy.&amp;#8217;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
Much of the uproar surrounding the Doctor&amp;#8217;s early lunch stems from his reputation as an extremely dedicated worker. &amp;#8216;He has only two loves: geology 
and his medical experimentation,&amp;#8217; said a former aquaintance, who is unable to be named to due to a mistake. &amp;#8216;I can tell you that he spends all of his 
free time conducting medical tests on his favourite subject, who he married several years ago. If anything, that is his passion, rather than geology. 
It takes up all his time, bombarding her with gamma rays, spiking her with sticks, dosing her up with experimental drugs. He has no time for 
relationships; he&amp;#8217;s married to his&amp;nbsp;wife.&amp;#8217;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sheer&amp;nbsp;terror&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many of Dr Logical&amp;#8217;s friends and colleagues are too terrified to speculate as to what time he will take his lunch break tomorrow. &amp;#8216;It&amp;#8217;s just not 
something that I feel I can comprehend at this point in time,&amp;#8217; said Prof Hitlerino. &amp;#8216;The enormity of yesterday&amp;#8217;s events haven&amp;#8217;t quite sunk in yet. We 
are all hoping and praying that he won&amp;#8217;t bring out his lunchbox and thermos before at least five past one tomorrow. But I&amp;#8217;m just not confident. If he 
eats lunch early again, may God have mercy on us&amp;nbsp;all.&amp;#8217;

The Metropolitan Police today called for the Moon to be removed from existence after numerous working problems were experienced by their&amp;nbsp;forces.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--BREAK--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Coleman Balls, the Deputy Assistant Commissioner, called on
theorists to reconsider the position and effectiveness of the Moon,
as it was proving a threat to effective policing in the
London&amp;nbsp;area.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Mr Balls explained, &amp;#8216;The Moon is proving particularly
counterproductive to the safe policing of the capital&amp;#8217;s
streets, especially in conjunction with the Theory of
Special Relativity. As it is obvious that this theory
has withstood experimental test and cannot be reworked,
it has to be that the Moon must&amp;nbsp;go.&amp;#8217;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Asked by our correspondent to explain his position,
Commissioner Balls continued &amp;#8216;Einstein&amp;#8217;s theory
postulates that photons of light have momentum,
and that some of this momentum is imparted to an
object when they interact with it. At night, the
Moon pours photons down onto the criminals on the
streets, supplying them with extra momentum and
giving them the ability to outrun our dedicated
team of patrol officers.&amp;#8217; When asked to comment 
on why his officers did not feel the same benefits
of this effect as the criminals, he pointed out that
&amp;#8216;criminals are usually black. I mean, wear black.
Dark substances act as black bodies and absorb more
radiation, and therefore the effect is more pronounced
on these&amp;nbsp;scoundrels.&amp;#8217;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Commissioner&amp;#8217;s idea would have important ramifications
if it was accepted by scientists. Without the Moon&amp;#8217;s
presence, the tides would fail, destroying sea life,
and the seasons would cease to meaningfully exist, and
the Earth may possibly spiral in towards the Sun,
causing certain death for all&amp;nbsp;Londoners.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Home Office, when contacted, could not return our
calls. However, Commissioner Balls&amp;#8217; idea is sure to be
discussed at next week&amp;#8217;s Meeting of Scientists in&amp;nbsp;Cheshire.

sophisticated grasp of mathematics, including the discovery of concepts 
hitherto unknown to mainstream&amp;nbsp;research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--BREAK--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research carried out by psychoscientists at Brixton University has 
demonstrated that prostitutes only ever congregate on street corners in 
prime numbers. Prior to this, it had long been assumed that prostitutes 
employed basic dynamic processes as an evolutionary consequence of 
dealing with drunken customers. Prof. Abject Poverty of the University&amp;#8217;s 
department said &amp;#8216;Hookers were always thought to have evolved to tout for 
business according to the logistic equation of population growth, and 
were therefore limited by the natural resources that a stretch of 
pavement could provide. However, these results suggest that some new, 
hidden, factors could be determining their&amp;nbsp;distribution&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof. Poverty and his colleagues have been able to show that the 
random walk process, when applied to slags, is intrinsically flawed, as 
they are subject to a previously unknown factor termed &amp;#8216;insubordinate 
dependence&amp;#8217;. This effect causes the women to be financially attracted 
towards supplies of narcotics, which distorts the mathematical things of 
the random walk theory. Prof. Poverty&amp;#8217;s team has observed that a 
superposition of prostitutes&amp;#8217; attractors bears similarities to the 
distribution of prime numbers, and may eventually lead to a more 
thorough understanding of non-integer-dimensional surfaces. 
&lt;p&gt;The results have aroused controversy in the scientific community, 
however. Dr Brian Awsh of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCL&lt;/span&gt; said &amp;#8216;the whole thrust of their argument 
is likely wrong. Their sample size of 412 prostitutes in the Milton Road 
area of Cambridge is far too small to be representative of the 
neighbourhood as a whole&amp;#8217;, while his colleague Dr James Ypres added 
&amp;#8216;Look at my face.&amp;#8217; However, Laris Hilson, of the Collectors&amp;#8217; Guild of 
Prostitutes, said &amp;#8216;This research may yield some interesting insights for 
the analysts of the sex industry. The idea that prostitutes could 
influence the proof of the Riemann hypothesis is not a new one, but a 
public vindication of their relevance in this field is long&amp;nbsp;overdue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some way to go before the ladies of the night are able to 
provide any relevant research data. However, the identification of two 
previously unrelated branches of science has many researchers excited. 
&amp;#8216;Who knows what this could lead to?&amp;#8217; asked Prof. Poverty, questioningly. 
&amp;#8216;There is new research being undertaken on infinite series of 
prostitutes that should hopefully be able to provide further insight 
into what, I think, is a very attractive young area.&amp;#8217;&lt;P&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>“Things not what they used to be,” says study</title><link href="http://news.wafti.org.uk/science/things-not-what-they-used-to-be-says-study" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Ross</name></author><id>tag:news.wafti.org.uk,2015-01-02:science/things-not-what-they-used-to-be-says-study</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A study recently commissioned by the British Legion has confirmed that several
aspects of modern culture such as fashion, values and mainstream music have
changed over the last six&amp;nbsp;decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several claims have been made by aged pressure groups for a number of years, but
this is the first time a comprehensive paper has been written up with a notable
amount of&amp;nbsp;rigour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions drawn by the report include indications that young girls wear
notably less clothing in public situations as they did pre-1960 &amp;#8212; an act
frequently deemed unacceptably deplorable by elderly interest&amp;nbsp;organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other findings included a detailed confirmation that music isn&amp;#8217;t the same as

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;They really knew how to sing a proper song back then; music today is just too
loud,&amp;#8221; concludes the first chapter of the two chapter dossier, which sampled
2,500 music recordings from the last sixty years for a thorough aural&amp;nbsp;examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most surprising revelation to some was the uncovering of how poor
current television programming is compared to how it has been in that&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/p&gt;

today despite new abstinence-only programmes now entering their second year of&amp;nbsp;running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources close to King Herod informed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAFTI&lt;/span&gt; that they received news this morning
that a teenager named Mary has in fact successfully given birth in the small
town of Bethlehem, Gloucestershire. This birth is controversial as the Bethlehem
district has, for over 18 months now, been a forerunner in the campaign for
teenage abstinence as a form of birth&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judean governmental figures have long cited abstinence as &amp;#8220;the only form of
birth control to be 100% effective&amp;#8221; and in August 2 B.C., the Herod
administration brought in a Judean-wide campaign to educate teenagers as to its&amp;nbsp;benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, protest groups have been claiming since the programme&amp;#8217;s introduction
that it is intrinsically flawed. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ve said from the start: this programme is
founded on untruths,&amp;#8221; claims Helen Trout, head of Leave Your Hat On, a
pro-condom pressure group, &amp;#8220;The simple fact is that if we are to promote real
birth control, then we must be educating our youngsters that they need to be
safe whatever decisions they choose to make. This incident is a kick in the face
to our government&amp;#8217;s ill-advised&amp;nbsp;schemes.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a hard issue, certainly and, at a stretch, we could see teenage sex
figures going down, but when it comes down to it our only shot at stopping this
flow is to promote safe usage of condoms. This incident has brought the issue to
a head and I hope now we see a push in the right&amp;nbsp;direction.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning&amp;#8217;s birth has certainly stirred a lot of controversy and it remains
to be seen how the government will move in light of these revelations. A source
close to King Herod informs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAFTI&lt;/span&gt;, &amp;#8220;The King is deeply troubled by the birth of
this child. It is unacceptable that such an anomaly should be allowed to ruin
such a beneficial programme and King Herod has promised to take whatever action
is needed, however&amp;nbsp;drastic.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Were Vikings the first on the moon?</title><link href="http://news.wafti.org.uk/science/were-vikings-the-first-on-the-moon" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-08-10T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Ross</name></author><id>tag:news.wafti.org.uk,2009-08-10:science/were-vikings-the-first-on-the-moon</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The authenticity of 15th century Viking map clearly depicting the moon five
centuries before Neil Armstrong&amp;#8217;s arrival has been confirmed by a great&amp;nbsp;Dane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map has been terribly controversial since its discovery in 1988, at which
time it was dismissed as Roman Catholic tomfoolery intended to discredit
Christopher Columbus during an intellectual property dispute. Lars Supper, grand
commissioner of the Danish Map School, claims that there is no sign of&amp;nbsp;forgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;We have run extensive tests between games of Cluedo and not once have we seen
evidence this was Catholic monkeyshines,&amp;#8221; Prof. Supper tells &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAFTI&lt;/span&gt; via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map shows Europe, Greenland and a large, round entity labelled &amp;#8220;Møøn&amp;#8221;. The
drawing is poor, but historians are quick to remind that art teachers were not
invented until the Great Depression in the 1930s. Also, the distance between
Greenland and what we now know today as the Moon, is totally inaccurate compared
to what we can determine by modern &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement of the area has now been linked to the Icelandic sagas of
Norsemen under Leif &amp;#8220;Sony&amp;#8221; Eriksson from around 1000 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these shortcomings, Prof. Supper maintains the map is clear evidence the
vikings were the first to send a ship to the moon. However, many killjoy
scientists remain&amp;nbsp;sceptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opponents have alledged that the ink used on the map contains a substance known
as mayonase titanium bromide, which today is only used in felt-tip pens &amp;#8212;
something not invented until the 16th century. This has now been disproved in
light of recent discoveries showing that Michaelangelo had used felt tips on the
ceiling of the Sistine&amp;nbsp;Chapel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;It&amp;#8217;s clearly silly; everybody knows Christopher Columbus was the first to
discover America,&amp;#8221; hints Ronald Watermelon, leading historian and director of
Columbus Tours. &amp;#8220;Anything to the contrary is just pissing in the&amp;nbsp;wind.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A British archeologist first discovered the map hanging from a telegraph pole in
Basingstoke, Nottinghamshire in 1957. It was then traded to the director of the
British Museum in 1965 for a David Beckham &amp;#8220;shiny&amp;#8221; during a lunch&amp;nbsp;break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There the map has remained until late 2008, when it was released for study.
Professor Lars Supper will present his findings during the Coronation Street
advert break next&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Anniversary of Moon Landing Reignites Conspiracy Claims</title><link href="http://news.wafti.org.uk/science/anniversary-of-moon-landing-reignites-conspiracy-claims" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-07-27T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Ross</name></author><id>tag:news.wafti.org.uk,2009-07-27:science/anniversary-of-moon-landing-reignites-conspiracy-claims</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Previously waning lunacy was in full view this month as the 40th anniversary of
the Apollo 11 mission sparked up fresh controversy over whether or not the moon
was&amp;nbsp;faked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 20th, 1969, the United States landed the first white, male human beings
on the surface of the Earth&amp;#8217;s moon with an estimated 1 billion eyes witnessing
the historic moment. Despite these 500 million observers, many conspiracy
theorists maintain the accusation that the entire moon is a hoax concocted by
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Government and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TUC&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;#8220;There is absolutely no way for the moon to
be possible, let alone for a man to walk on it,&amp;#8221; scoffs Geoffrey Van Allen,
founder of Lunar Sceptics, a moon-denying interest&amp;nbsp;group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;We have analysed 1000s of photographs taken of the moon and every single one
shows signs of tampering. The famous shot of Buzz Aldrin taken on its surface
could easily have been taken in any Asda car park and touched up in a&amp;nbsp;studio.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics of the hoax claims point to the continuing visibility of our lunar
compadre as seen through several devices such as telescopes, binoculars or&amp;nbsp;eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Look; it&amp;#8217;s right there,&amp;#8221; a scientist&amp;nbsp;explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;people&amp;#8221; of the conspiracy theory publication, &amp;#8220;Moon? Yeah, right&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; are
still not convinced by this salient&amp;nbsp;evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;We have testimonies from several Hollywood experts that expose a secret project
experimenting with sky projection technology capable of maintaining something
such as a picture of a moon in our skies perpetually. We have hard evidence this
project dates back years before the moon itself,&amp;#8221; explains Chief Editor Roy
O&amp;#8217;Rovers in a drawn-out game of&amp;nbsp;charades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other attempts to debunk the claims point to evidence from tidal patterns across
the globe &amp;#8212; now known by most outside of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; to be due to the gravitational
effect of the moon and not&amp;nbsp;Poseidon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;It&amp;#8217;s very clear that the wave machines used in novelty swimming baths today
were the side product of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; tide project,&amp;#8221; continued Mr. O&amp;#8217; Rovers
fervently. &amp;#8220;We have detected the main points at which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has stationed wave
generators to force a tidal effect &amp;#8212; all part of an elaborate scheme to act as
if there were a moon pulling on the&amp;nbsp;seas.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most astronomers were too busy with real work to respond to these claims, but a
group of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GCSE&lt;/span&gt; Science students were able to tell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAFTI&lt;/span&gt; they consider moon hoax

average 14-16 year&amp;nbsp;old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journal Monkey Tales has today published research in which cotton-top
tamarins were able to spot incorrect syntax and word usage far better than the
average &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GCSE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They familiarised the monkeys with introductary reading to the works of Roald
Dahl, Charles Dickens and Jeffrey Archer as well as conversational classes, then
recorded their reaction to Internet forums, Facebook profiles and a sample of
several Twitter&amp;nbsp;accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the experiment, they were shown so-called &amp;#8220;status updates&amp;#8221; as well as comment
posts across several websites. The aim was to investigate the ability to spot
flagrant misuse of words as well as incorrect&amp;nbsp;spellings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monkeys were trained to indicate what they deemed an abuse of the English
language in mild cases with a gesture of placing their palm over their faces;
larger mistakes were indicated with head-desk&amp;nbsp;interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same experiment was repeated with a sample of British &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GCSE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that monkeys were 20% more likely to recognise cases of
&amp;#8220;of&amp;#8221; being misused as a verb, 15% more likely to spot the incorrect use of
homophones such as &amp;#8220;there&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;their&amp;#8221; and a staggering 89% more likely to know
when an apostrophe should and should not be&amp;nbsp;used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Simple temporal ordering is shared with non-human animals,&amp;#8221; the lead researcher
tells &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAFTI&lt;/span&gt; News while drying his hair. &amp;#8220;This means we&amp;#8217;d expect basic levels of
language skill to be achievable even for&amp;nbsp;monkeys.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;However, it seems such simple aspects escape the generation now entering the
workplace. It&amp;#8217;s a prospect that is certainly cause for concern. If their
language skills are in fact lower than those of other primates, then we could
see them losing out on jobs to&amp;nbsp;them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has yet to comment on pressure to help protect British, human
workers from losing out to more competent immigrants from the same biological&amp;nbsp;order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;We need the government to put a stop to these monkey&amp;#8217;s coming into our country
and taking our jobs just because they are willing to work for peanut&amp;#8217;s,&amp;#8221; rants a
red-faced member of the British Numpty Party on a group called &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRITTISH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JOB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;S

smarter is just &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; gone&amp;nbsp;mad.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union is assembling a panel to investigate the research and its

experienced throughout much of the country over the last&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British Isles has always been home to much wetness, but its residents were
faced over the last seven days with a rather unusual difference. Since Monday
last week, there were several reports of a phenomon of white, icy particles
falling from the&amp;nbsp;sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;It&amp;#8217;s almost as if the rain froze before falling to Earth,&amp;#8221; suggests Patrick
Thistle, head of Water Sciences at Nottingham Trent&amp;nbsp;University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no good explanation at this early stage, but we&amp;#8217;ve been able to collect
samples and are running several tests. We hope to be able to describe the origin
of this phenonenom&amp;nbsp;soon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the country&amp;#8217;s roads and train lines have been closed off as Gordon Brown
declared a state of emergency on Thursday. Many commuters complained of unusual
behaviour from their&amp;nbsp;cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;This stuff is really bizarre,&amp;#8221; reports Sid Cup from Letchworth. &amp;#8220;I was doing my
usual commute to London and my car was sliding all over the road. My wife tried
to blame it on the white russians I had with my cereal, but I know this stuff
was involved&amp;nbsp;somehow.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Snowflake, chairperson of the Milton Keynes council informs she had to shut
down the whole mass transit system. &amp;#8220;We started getting reports of some bizarre,
white substance falling from the sky that was affecting local drivers&amp;#8217; ability,
so we decided to take no risks. At a time where nobody should be out in their
cars, the most sensible thing to do is to shut down all&amp;nbsp;buses.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;All that is known so far is the substance appears to be similar to or composed
of ice, perhaps alike the ice content of a&amp;nbsp;snowcone.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Milton Keynes residents have alikened the precipitate to the ground
covering inside the local indoor ski slope, known as the &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNO&lt;/span&gt;!zone&amp;#8221;. However,
management denies any&amp;nbsp;connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is known is that such a phenomenon has never been observed in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;
before. The Met Office has confirmed that its records show much cold rain, but
never anything comparable to recent&amp;nbsp;events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has sent a fact-finding group abroad to the Bahamas to hope to
acquire some scientific findings from our international&amp;nbsp;partners.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
