  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A North Stratford man has taken a decisive stand against the age-old home refurbishment edict by deciding not to use B&amp;Q as the supplier for his minor home improvement&nbsp;projects.</p>

<p>
The years-old inane advertising slogan encouraged its listeners to repair to their nearest B&Q store and &#8216;do it&#8217; with their selection of <span class="caps">DIY</span> ephemera, but Tony Ottoman-Sideboard decided to rise above the innuendo and reject B&Q&#8217;s&nbsp;philosophy.</p>

<p>
<span class="quo">&#8216;</span>It always seemed to me that B&Q and their competitors had been fixing prices on chipboard&#8217;, said Mr Ottoman-Sideboard, a part-time conspiracy theorist, &#8216;and so I decided to renounce the entire industry and only use organic produce in my wardrobing.&#8217; Mr Ottoman-Sideboard was reluctant to say where his organic products were sourced, but his estranged cousin and former business partner, Roger Flatpack, from Cheadle, was happy to speak to <span class="caps">WAFTI</span>.</p>

<p>
<span class="quo">&#8216;</span>Tony&#8217;s always been a bit of a leftie,&#8217; said Mr Flatpack, now Minister for Chemical Affairs, &#8216;and always stood out in our family. I&#8217;m not one to eulogise on family history, but the great Statesman himself had no problems with mass-produced softwood fixtures.&#8217; Mr Flatpack refused to elaborate&nbsp;further.</p>

<p>
The reason for Mr Ottoman-Sideboard&#8217;s actions remain a mystery. B&Q ceased the offending advertising campaign several years ago, and the company has since concentrated its efforts in claiming that they are the cheapest company around for all <span class="caps">DIY</span> purchases, whether the claim is true or&nbsp;not.</p>
