    <p>
Police recordings released under the Freedom from Information Act 2010 have revealed the surprising accounts of several convicted serial killers apologising for their&nbsp;actions.
</p>

<!--BREAK-->

<p>
In what some are calling a bold and unexpected move,
mass murderers such as Harold Shipman and Peter
Sutcliffe can be seen giving their heartfelt
apologies for the acts they committed and the lives
they&nbsp;affected.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I acted entirely out of my own selfish desires
and for that I am deeply, very sorry,&#8221; an apologetic
Harold Shipman is heard to say on video footage
acquired by <span class="caps">WAFTI</span> through entirely legitimate&nbsp;means.
</p>

<p>
A remorseful Peter Sutcliffe says, &#8220;I&#8217;m incredibly
sorry for my actions and the lives they&nbsp;affected.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
Similar statements can be heard from Myra Hindley,
Fred West and Trevor&nbsp;Hardy.
</p>

<p>
Whilst these statements have been a surprise to many,
many people have been calling it &#8220;too little, too&nbsp;late&#8221;.
</p>

<p>
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I&#8217;m not having it,&#8221; says Jane Button, a caretaker
from Crewe. &#8220;An apology this late is all well and good,
but it&#8217;s not going to get my husband&#8217;s pension
back or pay our&nbsp;mortgage.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
Will Fully-Ignorant, head of Lock Em Up &#8212; a prison
advocacy group &#8212; says he won&#8217;t accept the apologies.
&#8220;This is simply not good enough. It merely tells us
they knew full well what they were doing was wrong,
but they only cared about themselves. I&#8217;m not
having it. Lock them up, that&#8217;s what I&nbsp;say.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
The government is yet to release a statement on the
matter, but it believed that they will be looking
to divert even more tax money into bailing some of these
criminals out of&nbsp;prison.
