Mild reductions of bonuses at large financial companies, caused by stern headlines in the Daily Mail, have curtailed the feel-good fancy free attitudes of bankers everywhere, and it&#8217;s the golf courses who are&nbsp;suffering.
</p>

<!--BREAK-->

<p>
Once, hitting the fairway was enough to avoid the obstacles, 
but old favourites like the water hazard have been joined by a 
swathe of bleary-eyed bankers. Angry old men used to be considered
a staple of the golfing experience. Now, they are finding themselves
upstaged by angry middle-aged&nbsp;men.
</p>

<p>
Gary Quickwin works at Shortsighted Holdings. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard. We only have 
our salaries to live on, and who can manage on six figures alone? It&#8217;s a disgrace.&#8221; 
He paused to berate his caddy. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t plan ahead and have no savings, and I
also have a huge house. Who&#8217;s going to pay for that I ask&nbsp;you?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
His colleague, Tony Dontlook-Toohard, nodded in agreement. &#8220;It&#8217;s like, I do
all this work inventing money from nothing, right, and now I&#8217;m not getting
to keep it. Where&#8217;s the&nbsp;justice?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
They are not the only ones. All across Fritteraway Park,
there are hundreds of disgruntled investment bankers and&nbsp;economists. 
</p>

<p>
Who is the worst affected by this crisis however? The golf course owners 
themselves. A spokesman for the International Golfcourse Operators Association 
spoke to <span class="caps">WAFTI</span> News earlier today. &#8220;It&#8217;s terrible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t stock
Blue Label in the clubhouse any more, noone buys it. Everyone&#8217;s back on 
Maker&#8217;s Mark. We&#8217;ve had no choice but to reduce the number of holes -
we just can&#8217;t afford to pay someone to rake the cigarette butts out of the
bunkers any&nbsp;more.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
Asked whether the players themselves were upset at this, he responded 
&#8220;Not really - they&#8217;re just happier with their lower par. Noone seems
to have noticed that actually there&#8217;s less than they think there&nbsp;is.&#8221;
