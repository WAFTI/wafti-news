  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In a neck and neck dash for the country&#8217;s most pretigious award, Sony Music
Entertainment finally came out on top with the <span class="caps">UK</span> best-selling single for
Christmas over close rival: Sony Music&nbsp;Entertainment.</p>
<p>The surprise win was part of a campaign on Facebook and other social networking
sites to get Sony Music Entertainment to the godly number one spot in protest at
yet another number one from Sony Music&nbsp;Entertainment.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">UK</span> number one selling single was announced at 7pm on Sunday by the Queen as
part of her popular culture round-up of 2009 on Radio Four. She remarked it as
being a historic moment in the entire Commonwealth and a real testament to the
power of the people. She noted it as dwarfing lesser events such as the Storming
of the Bastille and the miners&#8217; strikes in the&nbsp;1980s.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Finally, after all the historic, but frankly rubbish, events of people
organising to make a difference to their world, we have something we can hold up
as a shining example of human achievement. All those involved should pat
themselves on the back, but I suspect they already have, &#8221; rambled her&nbsp;Majesty.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>For the past five years, Sony Music Entertainment has had that Christmas number
one spot with its manufactured pop music,&#8221; says Richard Porcupine, founder of
the group &#8220;Sod Sony; let&#8217;s get Sony to number one!&#8221; on&nbsp;Facebook.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>It&#8217;s refreshing to get Sony Music Entertainment to number one instead as a fart
in the face of crap music and capitalism. I am proud to have spear-headed this
campaign and I think everyone who made the effort to download a whole <span class="caps">MP3</span> should
be proud&nbsp;too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fans and supporters of the group are said to be &#8220;mental&#8221; with delight at the
news. One fan tells <span class="caps">WAFTI</span>: &#8220;I&#8217;m just so well glad we&#8217;ve made such a difference
in our world tonight. I&#8217;m proud to bring up my children in a world with the
majority of the country agreeing with my personal taste in music. This must be
how the Germans felt when the Berlin Wall&nbsp;fell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Porcupine&#8217;s group was the fastest growing group on Facebook, far outdoing
groups such as &#8220;A campaign to end the war in Afghanistan&#8221;, &#8220;People opposed to
the Digital Economy Bill&#8221; and &#8220;We support curing cancer, saving sick puppies,
declaring world peace and methods to convert human pollution into&nbsp;gold.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I think people latched onto our cause as the most worthy for backing,&#8221; drones
Dick Porcupine over his Twitter account. &#8220;People saw something terribly wrong
with our world and worked their hardest to fix it. Until today, people had to
endure the hardship of a song they didn&#8217;t like being the <span class="caps">UK</span> number one&nbsp;single.&#8221;</p>
<p>A press release from Sony Music Entertainment describes the company as &#8220;chuffed&#8221;
that they came out on top against Sony Music Entertainment. &#8220;The best way to win
in a free market is to get competition between two of your own products,&#8221;
laughed fat cat, Simon Custard over a large class of Château&nbsp;Latour.</p>
<p>Killjoy tosspots formed an apathy-driven campaign called &#8220;We don&#8217;t give a flying
panda&#8217;s testicle what the number one is&#8221; on Facebook, but not on Twitter as the
title alone exceeded the character limit for Twitter&nbsp;posts.</p>
<p>Their campaign manager finally got back to our enquiries last week with the
statement: &#8220;we really don&#8217;t care.&#8221; Critics have called his words &#8220;succinct&#8221; and
&#8220;missing the&nbsp;point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rumours have indicated that Richard Porcupine may be nominated for the Nobel
Prize for&nbsp;twattery.</p>
